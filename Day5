Slicing of the list
cars=('kia','maruthi',benz','bmw','audi','suzuki')
print(cars)
General syntax of slicing 
satrtvalue:stopvalue:stepcount ===> indexing no.
Note: List value or stop value is always exclusive than name,it will be inclusive than 
#req: I want to include save data and further in the same slice
print(cars[0:1])
Increase the index value by 1 to include the last value or stop value
print(cars[0:2])
print(cars[2:4])
print(cars[4:6])

step cout is skip the value one or two or... based on need
print(cars[0:6:2])
